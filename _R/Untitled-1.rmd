##### **What is tidy data?**

There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

    1. Each variable must have its own column
    2. Each observation must have its own row
    3. Each value must have its own cell

These three rules are interrelated because it is impossible to only satisfy two of the three.

##### **Pivoting**

There are two general ways in which a dataset can be untidy:

    1. One variable might be spread over multiple columns
    2. One observation might be scattered across multiple rows

In order to tidy such datasets we will use `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`

###### Longer Pivoting

Longer pivoting a dataset is needed when columns not variables but *values* of a variable. Lets take as an example table4:

```{r}
table4
```
